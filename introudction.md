# 🌐 Browser vs 🖥️ Node.js – Environment Differences

## 🌐 **Browser (Client-Side JavaScript Environment)**

- Has access to the **DOM** (Document Object Model)  
- Provides a **`window`** object as the global context  
- Used for **interactive applications** like web pages  
- **No access** to the local **filesystem** (for security reasons)  
- Faces **fragmentation** due to varying support across browsers  
- Uses **ES6 Modules** (`import` / `export`) for modular JavaScript  

---

## 🖥️ **Node.js (Server-Side JavaScript Runtime)**

- **No DOM** available (not designed to manipulate UI)  
- **No `window` object**; uses `global` as the global context  
- Built for **server-side applications** and backend development  
- Has full access to the **filesystem** via built-in `fs` module  
- Offers **version control** through Node.js runtime and package managers  
- Primarily uses **CommonJS Modules** (`require` / `module.exports`)
